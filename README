SnapMon
=======

The snapmon plugin makes it easy to make sure your application is being monitored.  When you install the plugin, it will ask you a series of questions on who should be notified when the plugin goes down.  It will then setup a snapmon.yml file in /config.  You can further customize your monitoring from there.

Install
=======

As a plugin:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/ryanstout/snapmon.git

As a gem:

  config.gem 'snapmon'


Capistrano
To automatically push your config settings add the following to your deploy.rb

  require 'snapmon/recipes'

Otherwise you can run rake setup_monitor

Each time you deploy (using Capistrano), your configuration will be updated on snapmon.com
